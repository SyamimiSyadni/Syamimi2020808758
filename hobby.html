<h1 style="background-color:#AFE1AF;">My Hobby</h1>
<p>Hobbies make us feel rejuvenated and satisfied, even when our lives are going through some disappointing phase. While others have been able to harness the power of their hobbies and converted them to money making ventures, many of us are just contented with the joy and satisfaction we derive from them. Let's know my hobby!</p>

<h2>1. <u>Listening to Music</u></h2>
<p>The benefits of listening to music include a reduction in stress and anxiety, an improvement in memory and reasoning, the promotion of cardiovascular health, an increase in pain tolerance, a reduction in depression, and an improvement in mood. It has been demonstrated to have a favorable impact on the body and also strengthens the immune system and enhances sleep. One of my favorite things to do after a difficult day is to relax with friends or family while listening to music. By letting go of any stress in my body and allowing it to relax, it will make me feel wonderful on the inside. I'll experience complete transformation!</p>

<h2 style="color:black">2. <u>Watching Movies</u></h2>
<p style="color:black">I've personally viewed dozens of movies in my lifetime, therefore it's extremely clear that watching movies can send our emotions on an emotional rollercoaster. Regardless matter the genre you watch in, this is equally true. Even better, you can choose a movie to watch based on how you feel or want to feel. Movies are made to inspire and tell stories, as well as to evoke strong feelings in the audience. Even if they are fictional, they enable us to relate to the characters. Below are the lists of movie that I had watched:</p>

<ul class="a" style="color:#800020">
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/BpdDN9d9Jio"><font color="#800020">A Quiet Place II</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/1d0Zf9sXlHk"><font color="#800020">Enola Holmes</a></li>

<h2 style="color:black">3. <u>Reading Novels</u></h2>
<p style="color:black"> Reading a novel can make me calm without thinking about any problems. I have been interested in reading novels since the 6th grade until now. I have read many novels from various genres such as thriller, romance, suspense and so on. Researchers have found Trusted Source that students who read books regularly, starting at a young age, gradually develop large vocabularies. And vocabulary size can influence many areas of your life, from scores on standardized tests to college admissions and job opportunities. Below are the novels that I had read. </p>
