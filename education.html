<h2> SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN TAMAN RIA </h2>
<p> I started going to school here from 1st grade to 6th grade in 2009 until 2014. During primary school I was <br> very active in extracurricular and in 2014, I had achieved flying colors in UPSR which was 5A at that time. <br> This school is close to my house and I go there only by bicycle.</p>

<h2> UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA </h2>
<p> After finishing high school, I continued my studies at the diploma level at Universiti Teknologi Mara Merbok, Kedah  but due to the Covid-19 <br> pandemic factor, I only  continued my studies online until semester 3. In semester 4, students were given the flexibility to attend to university <br> to continue learning. Currently, I am in semester 5 which is the last semester in the diploma level and will finish it next year. </p>
